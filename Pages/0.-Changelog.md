## Beta 0.8.4.1 2019-05-??
- Added --cu switch. When using batch mode (_kape.cli), allows for deleting config files when the batch run completes
- Added detection of CPU architecture (x86 vs x64) and a way to run x86 specific binaries for modules. See the "Modules" documentation for full details. In short, x64 support is assumed. If x86 is needed, name the binary the same as what is in the module, but end the name with '_x86'. Example: If you had Executable: foo.exe in a module, having a file named "foo_x86.exe" next to foo.exe, foo_x86.exe would be the actual program executed. Use --debug to see the selection process take place

## 0.8.4.0 2019-05-16
- Faster VSC discovery (4x faster!) and better timestamp resolution for VSC creation
- Improve VSC access to allow for copying out NTFS system files ($MFT, $J, etc.) from VSCs
- Tweak to when a directory shows up under --tdest (right before its needed vs earlier in previous releases)
- Reference files pulled from VSCs using ''VSS#' vs a path under ___vssMount for consistency
- Updated/new targets and modules
- Updated EZ Tools binaries
- General refactoring and cleanup

## 0.8.3.5 2019-05-03
- Fix for long file name issue when passing in multiple targets on the command line that caused the generated file names to become too long for containers

## 0.8.3.4 2019-05-01
- Fix for collecting from UNC paths

## 0.8.3.3 2019-05-01
- Updated nuget packages
- Fix issue copying files from VSS based on a change introduced in 0.8.3.2
- Handle long files paths gracefully when using container options. When a long file name is encountered, the file will be copied to a new name and the original full path/name is preserved in a text file in the <Root>\LongFileNames directory. The Copylog will still indicate original source and new destination

## 0.8.3.2 2019-04-24
- Truncate CopyLog filename when more than one target is used to avoid overly long file name creation
- Fix for rare issue when expanding wildcards in targets
- When using --sync, any targets or modules in !Disabled folders will be removed from the Targets or Modules directory so they stay disabled
- Added warning in gkape when either of the flush options are enabled. Also added a means to disable the warning in gkape
- Preserve last access timestamps even if last access updates are enabled.
- Tweak path detection so that things like '--tdest ..\destination' works, which allows for using relative paths on command line (i.e. when you do not know drive letter ahead of time)
- control and software updates
- When using --mlist and --mdetail, KAPE Will list any missing binaries along with the URL to download the missing files
- Updated to the most recent targets and modules

## 0.8.3.0 2019-03-15
- Added %kapeDirectory% variable that is replaced with the full path to where kape.exe was executed from. Useful for having a reference point for config files to pass to modules, etc.
- Added SFTP support. Server name, port, and username are required. See help screen for more details and switches. SFTP password, when present, will be redacted from the ConsoleLog
- Added zip to container options. Works like VHD(x) containers, except things just get zipped up
- When targeting $J, only copy the non-sparse part of the file. This makes for a much smaller (and faster!) collection
- Added _kape.cli support. _kape.cli should contain one or more KAPE command lines (one per line). When KAPE sees this file on start up, it executes one copy of KAPE per line in the file, then renames _kape.cli by adding a timestamp to the front of the file. See https://twitter.com/EricRZimmerman/status/1104212779299426304 for more details and example usage
- Remove --toe option
- In modules, for ExportFile property, %fileName% will get replaced using the name of the file being processed. Example: ExportFile: TeraCopy-history_%fileName%.csv 

## 0.8.2.0 2019-03-05
- Change ConsoleLog from being file based to memory based. ConsoleLog is saved to --tdest and/or --mdest as necessary
- Remove --dcl option since ConsoleLog is in memory now
- Added --sync switch to automatically update Targets and Modules from the KapeFiles GitHub repository
- Add --overwrite along with --sync to overwrite any local targets and modules
- In the ConsoleLog, remove extra line feeds and only show first letter of log level
- gkape updated to allow for editing and creating new targets and modules, including validation
- Added ability to specify multiple targets and modules on the command line (--target filesystem,eventlogs for example)
- Add Progress information to Title bar of Console or PowerShell window
- Gkape interface overhauled
- Added PowerShell script for automatic updates of the main KAPE package
- Add --mvars switch which allows passing in key:value pairs to modules
- Polish and tweaks


## 0.8.1.0 2016-02-16
- Add support for UNC paths for --tsource and --tdest
- Better detection when out of storage space on destination
- Add check when --mdest and --tdest are the same and disallow it
- Warn when --msource != --tdest
- Clarify EULA section 1.3 as it relates to usage
