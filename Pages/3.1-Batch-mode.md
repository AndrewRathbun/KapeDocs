# Batch mode

Batch mode works by placing one or more command lines (without the `kape.exe` part) into a file named `_kape.cli`. This file should contain one full command line on each line. This allows you to preconfigure KAPE to perform a given action (for example, collect certain files, zip them, then SFTP them to somewhere).

This allows you then run `kape.exe` as an Administrator (or, walking a remote customer/client/person through this process) and KAPE will do what it is told. All they need to do is right click `kape.exe` and run it as an Admin.

## Batch mode flow chart

For each line in `_kape.cli`, a new instance of KAPE will start using that line as its arguments.

When all lines in the file have been processed, the initial instance of KAPE renames the file, adding a timestamp to it, and exits. This lets you know when the file was processed and prevents subsequent executions of `_kape.cli` the next time KAPE is executed. Early on in batch mode, once the `_kape.cli` file is read, it is renamed to _`_kape.cli` (two underscores) so that none of the spawned KAPE processes try to repeat batch mode.

An example `_kape.cli` might look like this:

![_kape.cli](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EricZimmerman/KapeDocs/master/Pictures/kapecli.jpg)

When KAPE is run, if it finds `_kape.cli`, it will ignore all other options and process the `.cli` file, executing one copy of KAPE per line in the file, like this:

![_kape.cli running](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EricZimmerman/KapeDocs/master/Pictures/kapecli2.jpg)

Using the same example as above, when all KAPE instances have finished, you would end up with this:

![_kape.cli out](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EricZimmerman/KapeDocs/master/Pictures/kapecliOut.jpg)

Normally, once the `_kape.cli` file is processed it will be renamed and a timestamp is appended to the front of the file as mentioned above. This tells you when KAPE was run in batch mode.

In some cases however, you may want to delete as much as possible as it relates to KAPE so as to not leave sensitive information (as found in `_kape.cli`), Targets and Modules, etc. The `--cu` switch can be added to any of the command lines in `_kape.cli` and, if this switch is seen on ANY of the command lines, clean up mode will be activated. 

When in cleanup mode, KAPE will monitor the progress of all other KAPE instances spawned and wait for them all to exit:

Once all spawned KAPE processes have exited, the main KAPE process deletes `_kape.cli`, along with the Targets, Modules, and Documentation directories.

All that will remain is the two executables which do not do anything without Targets or Modules.

### Linear processing vs. "All at once" processing

Should you want to limit things to a single KAPE process running at once, adding `--ul` to one of the entries (it should be the first one in most cases) tells KAPE to wait for each instance of KAPE to exit before starting the next. When using this mode, you will only see one active instance of KAPE vs. multiple instances starting at once.
