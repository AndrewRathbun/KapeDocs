Modules work in a similar fashion to targets in that they look for certain types of files, but rather than copy them somewhere else, a module’s job is to run programs against files, often generating output in the form of CSV or text that can then be reviewed by an examiner. Modules have an **mkape** extension.

_Modules can only run ONE command; as such, you need a module for every executable you want to run against collected data._

Here is an example of what a module might look like:

![Module example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EricZimmerman/KapeDocs/master/Pictures/ModuleExample.jpg)

## Description
#### REQUIRED
This describes the purpose of the module and should contain enough detail to make it obvious what kinds of files will be processed. KAPE can dump full details about modules as well so each of the modules’ options are shown, but description serves as a nice summary of what is going to happen with this module.

## Category
#### REQUIRED
The category this module belongs to. In other words, what kind of artifact does the module process. Some examples include: ProgramExecution, Registry, FileFolderOpening, FileDownload, DeletedFiles, FileKnowledge, Location, ExternalDevices, AccountUsage, BrowserUsage, Persistence and Communications.

The Category is used to group modules that all target the same thing, so the output from say, amcache and shimcache will both end up in the same ProgramExecution output directory.

In short, related types of artifacts all end up in the same place, so it’s a one stop shop for all things related to a given category.

## Author
#### REQUIRED
The person who created the module. Should include at least name, but email address can also be included.

## Version
#### REQUIRED
The version of the module file. This should be incremented as additional processors are added, etc.

## Id
#### REQUIRED
# Modules

A unique (relative to all other modules) GUID that allows KAPE to track which modules have been processed. As we will soon see, modules can reference other module files and the Id field prevents KAPE from running the same module over if it should be referenced by one or more module files.

## ExportFormat
#### REQUIRED
This is used to pick the default export processor (discussed next) should a given program be able to export results in different formats. In the example above for LECmd, there are three processors defined. Unless specified otherwise on the command line, this module would export its results to csv by using the first processor in the list. Not all modules will have more than one processor and again, it is important to remember that only ONE processor will be run from any given module.

## FileMask
Optional variable that, when set, tells KAPE that this module is interested in files with the name specified. This is useful to target a specific file, like a SYSTEM Registry hive, or the $MFT.

## Processors
Processors is a list of available processors, where ONE will be chosen from the list. 

A processor breaks down as follows:

## Executable
#### REQUIRED
The name of the program to run. The path to the executable is NOT necessary and only the name of the executable (with extension) should be given.

##### Executable file locations
In most cases, this executable should be placed in the **[KAPE directory]\Modules\bin** directory, along with any additional support files it needs to run (like a license file, etc.). In the case where you have two executables you want to use with the same name, you can also place the executable in a directory named after the module. For example, if you had a module named LECmd.mkape that uses an executable named ‘LECmd.exe’, you could place this binary in the **[KAPE directory]\Modules\bin** folder OR make a directory under [KAPE directory]\Modules named ‘LECmd’ and place the binary in that directory (**[KAPE directory]\Modules\LECmd\LECmd.exe** for example).

When locating the executable, KAPE will first look for a binary in a directory named after the module.
If this directory is not found, the bin folder is checked. If the binary does not exist in either of those two
places, processing for the module will stop and a warning will be displayed on the console.

**NOTE**: If using mklink, the /h switch is required, or the executable will not be found. For example: 

`mklink /h "c:\KAPE\Modules\bin" densityscout.exe`

Without the /h switch the executable will not be found.

## CommandLine
#### REQUIRED
The parameters to pass to the executable. There are several variables that can be used that
will be replaced by KAPE at runtime:

| VARIABLE NAME | PURPOSE     | NOTES |
| ------------- |-------------| ----- |
| %sourceDirectory%  | The full path to the directory where all files can be found | Useful for modules that process several different kinds of files, like a strings utility, or something that knows how to process a directory and look for file masks on its own |
| %destinationDirectory%  | The full path to the root directory where a file will be saved   |   This will be the full path to the destination directory along with the name of the Category appended to it |
| %sourceFile% | For modules that use FileMask, the full path to the file      |    Useful for programs that expect a single file vs a directory |
| %kapeDirectory% | Replaced with the full path to where kape.exe was executed | Useful to have a reference point for config files to pass to modules, etc. |
| %fileName% | Replaced with the file name being processed by a module | This is specific to the ExportFile property |

In regard to the %fileName% variable, if your module was looking for ‘main.db’ and KAPE found one to process at C:\temp\tout\C\someDir\main.db, KAPE would replace %fileName% with main.db. It is useful to have the ExportFile property reflect the name of the file where the data came from, like this:

![fileName var](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EricZimmerman/KapeDocs/master/Pictures/fileNameVar.jpg)


## ExportFormat
#### REQUIRED
The output format for this processor. For programs that know how to export out different kinds of export formats, this allows you to define multiple "versions" to run based on what kind of output you want.

## ExportFile
An optional variable that, when set, will redirect standard out and standard error to the file name specified. This should be the name of a file ONLY and should not include any variables or other path information. 

As an example, consider this module:

![ExportFile example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EricZimmerman/KapeDocs/master/Pictures/ExportFileExample.jpg)

One reason for this capability is to handle tools that do not have an option to save the results directly to a file and rely on redirection to save the output. In the example above, an ExportFile value of "devices.txt" is specified. When this module is run, all output from cafae64.exe will be captured in devices.txt, located in %destinationDirectory%\<Category>. 

KAPE is also smart enough to not overwrite files if they already exist and will append a number to the end of the
file if more than one SYSTEM hive exists. This would then result in multiple ExportFile creation such as device.txt, device1.txt, device2.txt, and so on. With this said...

**WARNING: Do NOT try to use redirection on the command line. It will NOT work!** i.e. do not do this:

`CommandLine: -hive %sourceFile% -csv -devices -no_regkey_hdr > %destinationDirectory%\devices.txt`

As with targets, modules also understand referencing other modules, so we can do things
like this:

![Compound module example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EricZimmerman/KapeDocs/master/Pictures/CompoundModuleExample.jpg)

As was the case with targets, there is also a !ALL module that works in exactly the same way
as the target one did.
