# gkape

gkape is a graphical interface that wraps the command line version of KAPE. gkape expects to be:

1. Executed from the same directory as the main KAPE executable (`kape.exe`)
2. Run with administrator privileges.

Beyond running KAPE, gkape also contains an editor for Target and Module configurations, including automatic validation of configuration files. This enables the user to start with an existing template, make some adjustments, and then save the updated configuration to a new name.

When started, gkape looks like this:

![gkape](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EricZimmerman/KapeDocs/master/Pictures/gkape.jpg)

The interface consists of several sections, which are explained in greater detail below. At the top of each of each main section are check boxes: 

* Use Target options
* Use Module options. 

Checking one or both of these unlocks the section below.

Note that while interacting with the various sections in gkape, the current command line box at the bottom will display the equivalent command line. In fact, this is the exact command that will be executed when all minimum requirements are met. As options are selected, gkape determines if all required properties are set. When this is true, the **Execute** and **Copy** command buttons are enabled. This also enables the **Save** option under the **File** menu (more on this later).

Clicking the **Execute** button launches `kape.exe` with the displayed command line. A new window is displayed, showing what KAPE is doing. When KAPE is finished, press any key to close the window and return to gkape.

Clicking the **Copy** command button copies the entire displayed command line to the clipboard. This enables you to then paste the command into PowerShell or CMD to execute.

**NOTE**: gkape adds the "--gui" switch to the command line, which displays the "Press any key to exit" dialog when KAPE is done running. If you plan to use gkape to build the command line for use in a batch file, remove "--gui" or KAPE will not exit without a key press.

Finally, at the bottom middle of the gkape window is a Sync with GitHub button. Clicking this button enables you to update the local Target and Module configurations with what is available at [https://github.com/EricZimmerman/KapeFiles](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/KapeFiles).

Once gkape updates (and also when overwriting local data), any new Targets and Modules are shown:

## Target options
The Target options section looks like the screen below. Anything indicated in red is a required field. For Target source and Target destination, type a path, or use the "…" button next to the box to select a path. gkape remembers the paths that have been previously entered, so typing in the box will show matches. The dropdown can also be used to view and select previous entries.

To remove an entry, click the **X** to the right of the entry when the dropdown is showing

In the Targets grid, the checkbox to the left allows for selecting one or more Target configurations from the list. The columns at the top can also be used to sort and filter the list. As options are selected, the command line is shown at the bottom of the interface:

## Module options
Once again, areas shown in red in the Module options are required fields. When using the Target options at the same time as the Module options, note that in almost every situation leaving the Module source path empty is correct because KAPE will then use the Target destination value for Module source.

## Other options
These options shown below allow for displaying debug and trace messages, as well adding a password when creating zip files:

## Editing Target and Module configurations in the graphical interface
To edit a Target or Module configuration, double-click on a Target or Module’s name in the grid. The Editor is then displayed. 

Here we see an example for the Amcache Target:

![Amcache Module edit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EricZimmerman/KapeDocs/master/Pictures/amcacheModEdit.jpg)

From here you can adjust the configuration as needed. Any time the data has changed, the Save button will be enabled. Clicking the Save button validates the configuration. Any errors must be corrected before you will be able to save the configuration. 

In the example below, there is an extra space after the Name column. Clicking Save shows this validation error:

![Error highlighting](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EricZimmerman/KapeDocs/master/Pictures/ErrorHighlight.jpg)

Once the **OK** button is clicked, the Editor will do its best to highlight the invalid data as shown below. After the issue is corrected, the Save button will overwrite the existing configuration with the new data.

![Bad Yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EricZimmerman/KapeDocs/master/Pictures/BadYaml.jpg)

Use the **Save As** button to save to a new file. Be sure to update the GUID when using Save As. The Generate GUID button will generate a new, random GUID and copy it to the clipboard.

# gkape and batch mode
gkape can save the current command line (once it is valid and can be executed) to `_kape.cli` via the **File** menu option to save `_kape.cli`. If `_kape.cli` exists, gkape will prompt whether to append the current command line or overwrite the file.

If gkape finds an existing `_kape.cli` when it starts, it will attempt to load the configuration from the FIRST line in the .cli file and update gkape settings accordingly.
