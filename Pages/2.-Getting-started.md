# Getting started

KAPE is a standalone program that does not need to be installed. Decompress the zip file to aÂ directory of your choosing and you are ready to go. KAPE requires administrator rights when run, so launch PowerShell or other command window with administrator rights or KAPE will not execute.

Once KAPE is unzipped, the following files and directories will be available:

The Targets directory contains configuration files that determine what KAPE knows how to collect. There is also a !Disabled directory under the Targets directory. Any target files placed in this directory will not be available when running KAPE.

The Modules directory contains configuration files that determine what programs KAPE knows how to execute. There is also a !Disabled directory under the Modules directory. Any module files placed in this directory will not be available when running KAPE.

## Some basics

KAPE is primarily a command line based program. While there is also a graphical component that is available, its purpose is to help build a valid command line (more on this in the gkape section) and execute kape.exe.

When KAPE is running, the majority of the activity that KAPE is performing is displayed on the console. Other metrics related to KAPE activity is displayed in the Title bar of the console window, like this:

This gives you an idea of how much work is left to do, total files copied, and so on.

Running KAPE without any command line arguments shows all available arguments. There are two general categories of behavior in KAPE, Targets and Modules:

* Targets: Collect files
* Modules: Run programs (against collected files or otherwise)

Each of these will be discussed in depth in the next sections, but in short, targets search for files in a path. This can be a drive letter or UNC path. Once files are located, they need to be saved. Saving files works in much the same way in that a directory on a local drive or a UNC path can be specified.

### Long file name support
KAPE fully supports long file paths and has no issues dealing with them. However, when using the container options such as VHDX or Zip, these formats will not like paths longer than 255 characters. When container options are used, KAPE checks the path length and, if needed, will shorten overly long paths while preserving the original full path. When this happens, the overly long file will be saved to the LongFileNames directory under in the destination directory to a new name. The full path is also saved in a corresponding text file that is created which is named in a similar fashion to the original file. This lets you both know where things came from and be sure all files are collected, regardless of path length. Of course, all of this activity is also logged in the log files as well.

## Updating KAPE
The easiest way to update KAPE is to use the included PowerShell script, **Get-KAPEUpdate.ps1**, that compares the local version of KAPE with what is available online. If an updated version exists, it is downloaded and the local installation of KAPE is updated with the new version.

When a new version is posted online, it will contain all available targets and modules from the public KAPE GitHub repository, found here, that contains all available Target and Module configurations.

## Automatic syncing with GitHub repo
The --Sync option is used to help keep targets and modules up to date. By default, using --sync will update all targets and module configurations with what is available on the GitHub repository. The default is to overwrite all existing files with whatever is on the server, but there is another option you can use to disable this, --sow. Since --sow is true by default (sow stands for 'sync overwrite'), if you want to disable overwriting, you would use --sync --sow false.

Here is an example of what this might look like. Notice that KAPE reports both updates and changes to existing configurations. When KAPE compares existing configurations, the SHA-1 is used to determine if the local files are the same as the remote files.

If overwriting is disabled via --sow false, any updated configurations would be reported as having an update available but skipped since overwriting is disabled.

Using this option allows you to stay current with the most up to date target and module configurations. For modules, it is of course still necessary for you to place the proper binaries where they belong before using the modules.

To see a list of missing module executables, use --mlist --mdetail. Any missing binaries will be displayed, like this:

![Missing binaries](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EricZimmerman/KapeDocs/master/Pictures/missingBinaries.jpg)

From here you can download any missing binaries and place them in the appropriate location (the Modules\bin directory). KAPE does not automatically download and install binaries for your protection. By requiring an end user to download and take proactive steps to place an executable in a location where KAPE can use it, the end user can be sure KAPE is only doing what they tell it to do.
