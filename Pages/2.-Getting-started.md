# Getting started

KAPE is a standalone program that does not need to be installed. Decompress the zip file to aÂ directory of your choosing and you are ready to go. KAPE requires Administrator rights when run, so launch PowerShell or other command window with Administrator rights or KAPE will not execute.

Once KAPE is unzipped, the following files and directories will be available:

![Directory view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EricZimmerman/KapeDocs/master/Pictures/dirView.jpg)

The Targets directory contains configuration files that determine what KAPE knows how to collect. There is also a `!Disabled` directory under the Targets directory. Any Target files placed in this directory will not be available when running KAPE.

The Modules directory contains configuration files that determine what programs KAPE knows how to execute. There is also a `!Disabled` directory under the Modules directory. Any Module files placed in this directory will not be available when running KAPE.

## Requirements
* Administrator rights
* Microsoft .NET 4.52 or newer. If you need to install .NET, click [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42642) to get the .NET 4.5 installer.

## Some basics

KAPE is primarily a command line based program. While there is also a graphical component that is available, its purpose is to help build a valid command line (more on this in the gkape section) and execute `kape.exe`.

When KAPE is running, the majority of the activity that KAPE is performing is displayed on the console. Other metrics related to KAPE activity is displayed in the Title bar of the console window, like this:

This gives you an idea of how much work is left to do, total files copied, and so on.

Running KAPE without any command line arguments shows all available arguments. There are two general categories of behavior in KAPE, Targets and Modules:

* Targets: Collect files
* Modules: Run programs (against collected files or otherwise)

Each of these will be discussed in depth in the next sections, but in short, Targets search for files in a path. This can be a drive letter or UNC path. Once files are located, they need to be saved. Saving files works in much the same way in that a directory on a local drive or a UNC path can be specified.

### Long file name support

KAPE fully supports long file paths and has no issues dealing with them. However, when using the container options such as VHDX or Zip, these formats will not like paths longer than 255 characters. When container options are used, KAPE checks the path length and, if needed, will shorten overly long paths while preserving the original full path. When this happens, the overly long file will be saved to the LongFileNames directory under in the destination directory to a new name. The full path is also saved in a corresponding text file that is created which is named in a similar fashion to the original file. This lets you both know where things came from and be sure all files are collected, regardless of path length. Of course, all of this activity is also logged in the log files as well.

### Mounting forensic images for use with KAPE

Use [Arsenal Image Mounter (AIM)](https://arsenalrecon.com/downloads/) to access E01s and other forensic images. While there are other tools out there to mount images, AIM exposes the image as a physical device, which means the Volume Shadow Copies are made available to KAPE. AIM is free, so there is no reason to not use it.

WARNING: Do not use FTK Imager, Dokan, or similar! They will not work properly!

It is also recommended to mount E01s that are local to the system where KAPE will be run. Mounting image files over a network can cause issues if there is any disruption to the network connection, which can result in errors.

## Updating KAPE

The easiest way to update KAPE is to use the included PowerShell script, **Get-KAPEUpdate.ps1**, that compares the local version of KAPE with what is available online. If an updated version exists, it is downloaded and the local installation of KAPE is updated with the new version. 

![Updating](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EricZimmerman/KapeDocs/master/Pictures/update.jpg)

When a new version is posted online, it will contain all available Targets and Modules from the public KAPE GitHub repository, found [here](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/KapeFiles), that contains all available Target and Module configurations.

## Automatic syncing with KapeFiles repository

The `--sync` option is used to help keep Targets and Modules up to date. Using `--sync` will update all Targets and Module configurations with what is available on the GitHub repository.

Here is an example of what this might look like. Notice that KAPE reports both updates and changes to existing configurations. When KAPE compares existing configurations, the SHA-1 is used to determine if the local files are the same as the remote files.

![Sync update](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EricZimmerman/KapeDocs/master/Pictures/updateSync.jpg)

Using this option allows you to stay current with the most up to date Target and Module configurations. For Modules, it is of course still necessary for you to place the proper binaries where they belong before using the Modules.

To see a list of missing Module executables, execute

`kape.exe --mlist . --mdetail`

(Be sure to do this for each folder you are interested in). Any missing binaries will be displayed, like this:

![Missing binaries](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EricZimmerman/KapeDocs/master/Pictures/missingBinaries.jpg)

From here you can download any missing binaries and place them in the appropriate location (the `.\KAPE\Modules\bin directory`). KAPE does not automatically download and install binaries for your protection. By requiring an end user to download and take proactive steps to place an executable in a location where KAPE can use it, the end user can be sure KAPE is only doing what they tell it to do.

## Automatic syncing of Module tools

Multiple Module tools like RECmd or EvtxECmd are included in a tool sync Module [!!ToolSync](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/KapeFiles/blob/master/Modules/!!ToolSync.mkape).
It runs the tools using their sync parameters. Using `--debug` switch when invoking KAPE, the changes are shown in the console.

Use the sync Module individually or at the start of the other Modules to run to update the tools before using the corresponding modules.

```
.\kape.exe --msource C:\ --mdest C:\temp\null --module !!ToolSync --debug

.\kape.exe --msource D:\ --mdest C:\temp\mout --module !!ToolSync,RECmd,EvtxECmd, ... 

.\kape.exe --msource D:\ --mdest C:\temp\mout --module !!ToolSync,RECmd,EvtxECmd, ... --debug
```
