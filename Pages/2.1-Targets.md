# Targets

Targets are used to define parameters primarily based around file paths on a given volume. For example, Registry hives live at `C:\windows\system32\config` and include `SOFTWARE`, `SAM` and `SYSTEM` hives for example. Another example of possible Targets includes file system related files, such as `$MFT`, `$LogFile` and `$J`. Targets have a **tkape** extension.

Targets should always be created to Target specific artifacts that can be grouped together. In other words, making a single Target that collected Registry, file system, and browser history would be incorrect. Making specific Targets based on a specific thing allows for more granular collections on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, KAPE knows how to process Targets that are made up of other Targets and this is the proper way to collect more than one thing at a time.

Here is an example of what a Target configuration looks like to collect Prefetch related files:

![Target example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EricZimmerman/KapeDocs/master/Pictures/TargetExample.jpg)

There are several descriptive fields at the top of the file, followed by a collection of file specifications. Let’s take a closer look at each of these fields.

## Description
<font size="3" color="red">REQUIRED</font>
This describes the purpose of the Target and should contain enough detail to make it obvious what
kinds of files will be collected by the Target. KAPE can dump full details about Targets as well so
each of the Target’s paths are shown, but description serves as a nice summary of what is going to
happen with this Target.

## Author
<font size="3" color="red">REQUIRED</font>
The person who created the Target. Should include at least name, but email address can also be included.

## Version
<font size="3" color="red">REQUIRED</font>
The version of the Target file. This should be incremented as additional Targets are added, etc.

## Id
<font size="3" color="red">REQUIRED</font>
A unique (relative to all other Targets) GUID that allows KAPE to track which Targets have been processed. As we will see soon, Targets can reference other Target files and the Id field prevents KAPE from running the same Target over if it should be referenced by one or more Target files.

## Recreate Directories
<font size="3" color="red">REQUIRED</font>
If true (and it should pretty much always be true), KAPE will recreate the path for where it found a file in the destination directory. In other words, if you are saving Registry hives from the D Drive and are exporting Targets to c:\temp\tout, KAPE would create the following directory structure:

**c:\temp\tout\windows\system32\config**

and then copy each of the hives to this new folder. This essentially allows KAPE to mimic the file structure from the source device to the destination folder.

## Targets
Targets is a list of Target objects. 

NOTE: At least one Target is required!

A Target breaks down as follows:

## Name
<font size="3" color="red">REQUIRED</font>
The descriptive name of the file. This is NOT used to find the file, but rather is just a friendly
name for the Target.

## Category
<font size="3" color="red">REQUIRED</font>
The general category for the Target. Examples include: FileSystem, Registry and EventLogs, and so on.

## Path
<font size="3" color="red">REQUIRED</font>
The path to the file to be collected. EVERY Target should be treated like it originates on the C drive. The actual Target drive letter will be replaced by KAPE when it runs, but for simplicity, always specify the path to the file or directory as shown in the example. The path can contain wild cards as well. The `*` character can be used as a placeholder when more than one directory may exist for a given path. For example, in the case of `NTUser.dat` and
other profile specific files, a path value of:

**Path: C:\Users\\*\\**

Can be used, which KAPE would expand out to match all the profiles on a given computer. The wild card can be used in place of a directory. Here is another example: 

**Path: C:\Documents and Settings\\*\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Outlook\\**

This path in conjunction with a FileMask of `'*.pst'` would result in all PST files being collected from all available user profiles on the system.

While not required, for consistency, all directory names should end with a backslash to make it clear path denotes a directory.

In some cases, it is helpful to reference a subdirectory under the Targets folder to pull in, rather than hard code several Targets. This is possible by setting Path to the name of the subfolder, followed by a backslash and the wildcard character.

For example: To pull in all Targets under `Targets\Antivirus`, use **Path: Antivirus\\***

## Recursive
When true, will recursively copy everything from Path. This option also takes FileMask into account. If this property is missing, it is assumed to be false

## FileMask
When set, look in Path for files matching the provided extension. IsRecursive determines if the search is for Path only, or all directories below Path are also searched.

If this property is omitted, it is assumed to be `*`, which will match all files in Path.

Typically, a pattern like `'\*.jpg'` would be specified. Under the hood, KAPE will convert this to a regular expression: `'.+\\.jpg'`. Note that you can also, as of v0.9.2.0, specify masks such as `'Foo*.txt'` or `'\*Wizzo*.jpg'` and KAPE will do the rest.

For more powerful filtering, KAPE allows for supplying a regular expression for FileMask by prepending the FileMask value with `'regex:'``. For example: 

**FileMask: regex:(2019|DSC|Log).+\\.(jpg|txt)**

Regardless of the file mask used, KAPE will add \A to the beginning of the regex and \z to the end, so that the _entire_ filename will be matched (In other words, a partial match will NOT be copied).

## SaveAsFileName
When set, overrides the name that will end up being saved in the Target destination folder. Useful for Alternate Data Streams such as `$SDS` or `$J`

## AlwaysAddToQueue
When true, the Path will always be added to the copy queue. This is useful for dealing with,
file system related files for example that the operating system may say do not exist, such as
$LogFile, when run on a live system. By setting this to true, these files will be queued and
extracted regardless of what the operating system says (assuming they actually exist, of course).

WARNING: Do not set this unless it is necessary! In other words, the default should be false for this and it should be set to true only when you know the file exists.

## Comment
A free form field to pass along necessary information.

## MinSize
The minimum size of a file to include, in bytes. Any files smaller than this are dropped. Enable --debug to see dropped files

## MaxSize
The maximum size of a file to include, in bytes. Any files bigger than this are dropped. Enable --debug to see dropped files

# Compound Targets
As mentioned earlier, Target files should be very specifically focused on a given type of file. Some examples include file system, web browsers, event logs and so on. To collect more than one kind of file at a time, a new Target can be created that references other, more granular Targets. 

As an example, a partial Target file for Chrome looks like this:

![Chrome Target example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EricZimmerman/KapeDocs/master/Pictures/ChromeTargetExample.jpg)

And a Target for Firefox looks like this:

![Firefox example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EricZimmerman/KapeDocs/master/Pictures/FirefoxTargetExample.jpg)

These Targets are defined in separate Target files: Chrome.tkape and Firefox.tkape.

Consider the case where we want to process ALL web browsers. While we could run KAPE three times and use each Target once, it is easier to wrap each of the Targets we want to run inside a new Target file, one related to Web browsers. 

Such a file might look like this:

![Compound Target example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EricZimmerman/KapeDocs/master/Pictures/CompoundTargetExample.jpg)

For the most part, the Target file looks like any other Target file we have already seen. The difference here is that the Path variable refers to the name of one of the more fine-grained Target files. When KAPE sees this, it expands the referenced Target file and pulls in all the file specifications contained in each referenced Target file.

This allows as many layers as you want to be incorporated into Target files. 

# !Disabled

The `!Disabled` folder provides the end user with the opportunity to store Targets within their KAPE instance that they don't want to appear in the active Targets list. Currently, there exists some disabled Targets that can give you a running start for creating directory traversal to meet your own needs. To illustrate this, see the demonstration below:

![DisabledFolderDemo](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/KapeDocs/blob/master/Pictures/DisabledFolderDemo.jpg)

# !Local Folder

The `!Local` directory provides the end user with the opportunity to store their own custom Targets that may not have a widespread application for the general public. An example of this can be a Target created specifically for your internal corporate environment or even a Target created to simply grab all the `.jpeg` on your personal system for archiving purposes. 

If a Target exists within your KAPE instance that isn't apart of the official [KapeFiles](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/KapeFiles) GitHub repo, when a `.\kape.exe --sync` command is ran (or either of the `!!ToolSync`/`Sync_KAPE` Modules), the Target that doesn't exist in the public repo will be moved to the !Local folder. To illustrate this, see the demonstration below:

![KapeSyncLocalDemo](https://github.com/EricZimmerman/KapeDocs/blob/master/Pictures/KapeSyncLocalDemo.gif)
