# SFTP mode

Depending on your needs, you can create read only users, write only users, full access users, and so on. Users can also be restricted to their own home directories (via 'Jail' property) or allowed access to the root of the SFTP server (for an admin for example)

Example configuration is available [here](Configs\config.skape)

There are several descriptive fields at the top of the file, followed by a collection of users. Letâ€™s take a closer look at each of these fields.

## Port
<font size="3" color="red">REQUIRED</font>
The port to bind to. All available IP addresses (IPV4 and IPV6 will be bound to). When the server starts up, all IP addresses are listed.

## HomeDirectory
<font size="3" color="red">REQUIRED</font>
The root of the SFTP server. This should be a path to a directory, like 'C:\temp\sftp\Root'

## LogDirectory
<font size="3" color="red">REQUIRED</font>
The directory where to save the SFTP server log to. This should be a path to a directory, like 'C:\temp\sftp\Log'

Note this is different from the Console log which will be saved when the server closes down in the directory where kape.exe was launched from.

## LogLevel
<font size="3" color="red">REQUIRED</font>
The level of detail to include in the SFTP server log. Possible choices are: Error | Info | Debug | Verbose | Off

Note that 'Verbose' is just that and will include information on authentication from clients, including passwords.

## Users
Targets is a list of users the server should create. 

NOTE: At least one user is required!

A user breaks down as follows:

## UserName
<font size="3" color="red">REQUIRED</font>
The name of the user account to log in with.

## Password
<font size="3" color="red">REQUIRED</font>
The password to log in with.

## Access
<font size="3" color="red">REQUIRED</font>
The permission the user should be assigned. This should be specified as a pipe delimited string using one or more of the following: 

Read|Write|Create|Delete|List|All

Examples:

Read|List
Create|Write
All

## Jail
<font size="3" color="red">REQUIRED</font>
When false, user's home directory is set to the value of 'HomeDirectory'
When true, user will be chrooted to 'HomeDirectory\UserName' directory


# Example

 Once the server is running, it might look like this:
