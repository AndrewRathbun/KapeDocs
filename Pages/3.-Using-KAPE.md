# Using KAPE

KAPE is a command line tool, and as such, has several switches that are used to interact with it.

A list of all available switches is shown below.

![Options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EricZimmerman/KapeDocs/master/Pictures/kapeoptions.jpg)


Common usage scenarios may include the following:

* Using target options to find and build a VHDX file to move to a different location for processing.
* Using target and module options to find and process files, resulting in output that can be reviewed for leads, etc.
* Using module options for processing a live system or mounted directory. This option would be slower than option one or two because many more files and directories would have to be searched to find the files the various processors want.

Before looking at each individual switch, it is helpful to see the overall program execution as it relates to targets and modules. On the next few pages, flow charts are shown that illustrate how the various options (discussed in detail in the next section) work with each other.

## Command line switches
Command line switches are broken down into three general groups: target related, module related, and other.

## Target switches

### tsource
<font size="3" color="red">REQUIRED</font>
The drive letter to search. This should be formatted as C, D:, or F:\. UNC paths are also supported.

### target
<font size="3" color="red">REQUIRED</font>
The target configuration to run, without the extension. Get a list of all available targets with the --tlist switch. You can specify multiple target names at once by separating them with a comma (no spaces).

KAPE can also pull all configs under a directory specified in --target. In this way, directories act like a compound config

### tdest
<font size="3" color="red">REQUIRED</font>
The directory where files should be copied to. This directory will be created if it does not exist. This can be a regular directory or a UNC path.

The following variables are supported:

|  Variable | Replacement  |
|---|---|
|%d   |Timestamp (yyyyMMddTHHmmss)   |
|%m   |Machine name   |


### tlist
Displays available targets including the name and description.

### tdetail
Like --tlist, but also includes additional details on each target including file paths, category, etc.

### tflush
When true, deletes the directory specified by --tdest (if it exists) before searching.

### tdd
Deduplicate files from --tsource and, if enabled, VSCs based on their SHA-1 value. The first file found during target processing wins. This is generally the "active" file vs one from a VSC. Set to false to copy all files from --tsource and VSCs.

### hex
When given the path to a text file containing one SHA-1 per line, KAPE will not copy any files found during processing with a hash matching anything in the file. All excluded files are recorded in the 'skiplog.csv' file with a reason of "Excluded". These files are also logged in 'copylog.txt'

## Module switches
### msource
The directory containing files to process. This is usually --tdest when run in conjunction with target switches. When using target options, this option can be left empty and the value for --tdest will be used for --msource

### module
<font size="3" color="red">REQUIRED</font>
The module configuration to run, without the extension. Get a list of all available modules with the –mlist switch. You can specify multiple module names at once by separating them with a comma (no spaces).

KAPE can also pull all configs under a directory specified in --module. In this way, directories act like a compound config

### mdest
<font size="3" color="red">REQUIRED</font>
The directory where output from processors should be created. This directory will be created if it does not exist. This can be a regular directory or a UNC path. This serves as the root directory and additional subdirectories will be created based on the categories found in module configurations.

The following variables are supported:

|  Variable | Replacement  |
|---|---|
|%d   |Timestamp (yyyyMMddTHHmmss)   |
|%m   |Machine name   |


### mlist
Displays available modules including the name and description

### mdetail
Like --mlist, but also includes additional details on each module including command lines, category, etc. This option also shows a list of all modules where the executable could not be found, along with the URL to download the binaries from.

### mflush
When true, deletes the directory specified by --mdest (if it exists) before processing files.

### mvars
Provide a list of key:value pairs to be used for variable replacement in modules. Separate multiple variables with ^

For example, this command:

`--mvars foo:bar^name:Eric^Level:Over9000`

would result in the following variables being available in module files: 

%foo%
%name%
%Level%

Each of these would then be replaced with the value portion of the key:value pair, so if a module's command line referenced something like:

`-f %sourceFile% -r %foo% -n %name% -L %Level%`

KAPE would replace the variables at run time before executing the command, like this:

`-f C:\some\path\toFile.txt -r bar -n Eric -L Over9000`

This allows you to pass things in like computer names, IP addresses, or anything else you need without me having to add explicit support for every variable.



### mef
The export format to use (csv, txt, json, etc.) when running processors. This overrides the default in the module configuration. If the format does not exist, the first available processor (i.e. the default) will be chosen.


## Volume Shadow copy switches
### vss
Find, mount, and search all available Volume Shadow Copies on --tsource. Default is false. Set to true to process VSCs.


## Container switches

NOTE: Container switches expect a base name after the switch! If none is provided, the switch will be ignored and no container will be created!

### vhd
Creates a VHD virtual hard drive from the contents of --tdest. This switch is used as a part of the file name for the VHD file. For example, if 

`--target EvidenceOfExecution --vhd EricWorkstation `

was run, the corresponding VHD file would be named something like:

**2018-09-03T144144_EvidenceOfExecution_EricWorkstation.vhd**

### vhdx
Creates a VHDX virtual hard drive from the contents of --tdest. This switch is used as a part of the file name for the VHDX file. 

### zip
Creates a zip file from the contents of --tdest. THis switch is used as a part of the file name for the Zip file.

## SFTP/SCP switches
### scs
SFTP server host/IP for transferring *compressed VHD(X)* container and/or zipped module output

### scp
SFTP server port. Default is 22

### scu
SFTP server username. Required when using --scs

### scpw
SFTP server password. 

NOTE: SFTP password, when present, will be redacted from the ConsoleLog.

### scc
Comment to include with transfer. Useful to include where a transfer came from. Defaults to the name of the machine where KAPE is running

## AWS S3 switches
### s3r
AWS region to use. Be sure to use the system name as supplied by AWS. Full list at https://amzn.to/2pIxOVG Example: us-west-1

### s3b
The bucket name to use. Example: kape-test

### s3k
The Access key for the bucket. Must at least be writable. Example: AKIAXKDAGGVYYXDZKHNR1

### s3s
THe Access secret for the bucket. Example: ulJqM2mJAu2lVBhpi5UrL+X+8hL+LOYOJryhp2s2

### s3c
Comment to include with transfer. Useful to include where a transfer came from. Defaults to the name of the machine where KAPE is running

## Azure Storage switches
### asu
A SAS Uri with at least write permissions for Azure core storage. When generating the SAS Uri, be sure to do so on the container so it is included in the Uri.

Example: https://kapeupload.blob.core.windows.net/test/?sp=racwdl&st=2019-08-07T16:07:44Z&se=2019-08-08T16:07:44Z&sv=2018-03-28&sig=R45Xi1Am8jNCgvBFEyBOmPvFkXym0CbI0KfDOXdc6IM%3D&sr=c

Notice 'test/' before the ?. Here, test is the container where the files should be uploaded to. KAPE will take care of supplying file names.

### asc
Comment to include with transfer. Useful to include where a transfer came from. Defaults to the name of the machine where KAPE is running

## Compression switches
### zv
If true, zip the VHD(X) file, resulting in a (usually) MUCH smaller file. Default is true.

### zm
If true, zip the contents of --mdest. Default is false.

### zpw
Zip password. Used when any of the zip related options are used (--zv | --zm | --zip)

## Diagnostic switches
### debug
When true, enables debug messages. This will result in more details as to what KAPE is doing in the background as it runs.

### trace
When true, enables trace messages. This will result in an even larger amount of information to be generated about what KAPE is doing as it runs.

## Update switches
### sync 
When true, update available Targets and Modules from https://github.com/EricZimmerman/KapeFiles

## Other switches
### guids
Generate 10 random GUIDs and exit. Useful when creating new targets and modules

### gui
If true, keeps the KAPE window open when it finishes until a key is pressed. Usually used in conjunction with gkape

### ul
When using _kape.cli, when true, KAPE will execute entries in _kape.cli one at a time vs. in parallel. Default is FALSE

NOTE: --ul is required on each line in order for things to continue to be linearly processed. This lets you have 5 lines in a batch file, with --ul on the first three. These would be run one one after the other. If the last two do not have --ul they would then be run at the same time.

### cu
When using _kape.cli, if true, KAPE will delete _kape.cli and both Target/Module and Documentation directories upon exiting. Default is FALSE. See Batch mode for more information.

### sftpc
Enables KAPE's built-in SFTP server. Expects full path to config file. See [here](Pages\6.-SFTP.md) for full details and example configuration
