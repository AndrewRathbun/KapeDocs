# What is KAPE

Kroll Artifact Parser and Extractor (KAPE) is primarily a triage program that will target a device or storage location, find the most forensically relevant artifacts (based on your needs), and parse them within a few minutes. Because of its speed, KAPE allows investigators to find and prioritize the more critical systems to their case. Additionally, KAPE can be used to collect the most critical artifacts prior to the start of the imaging process. While the imaging completes, the data generated by KAPE can be reviewed for leads, building timelines, etc.
