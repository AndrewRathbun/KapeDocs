# What is KAPE

Kroll Artifact Parser and Extractor (KAPE) is primarily a triage program that will target a device or storage location, find the most forensically relevant artifacts (based on your needs), and parse them within a few minutes. Because of its speed, KAPE allows investigators to find and prioritize the more critical systems to their case. Additionally, KAPE can be used to collect the most critical artifacts prior to the start of the imaging process. While the imaging completes, the data generated by KAPE can be reviewed for leads, building timelines, etc.

## How KAPE works
KAPE serves two primary functions: 1) collect files and 2) process collected files with one or more programs. By itself, KAPE does not do anything in relation to either of these functions; rather, they are achieved by reading configuration files on the fly and, based on the contents of these files, collecting and processing files. This makes KAPE very extensible in adding or extending functionality.

KAPE uses the concepts of targets and modules to do its work. KAPE comes with a range of default targets and modules for most common operations needed in most forensic exams. These can also be used as examples to follow to make new targets and modules.

At a high level, KAPE works by adding file masks to a queue. This queue is then used to find and copy out files from a source location. For files that are locked by the operating system, a second pass takes place that bypasses the locking. At the end of the process, KAPE will make a copy and preserve metadata about all available files from a source location into a given directory.

The second (optional) stage of processing is to run one or more programs against the collected data. This works by either targeting specific file names or directories. Various programs are run against the files and the output from the programs is then saved in directories named after a category, such as EvidenceOfExecution, BrowserHistory, AccountUsage, and so on.

By grouping things by category, examiners of all levels have a means to discover relevant information regardless of the individual artifact that a piece of information came from. In other words, it is no longer necessary for an examiner to know to process prefetch, shimcache, amcache, userassist, and so on as it relates to evidence of execution artifacts. By thinking categorically and grouping output in the same way, a wider range of artifacts can be leveraged for any given requirement.
